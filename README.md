# Bank Loan Predition Using Machine Learning and Streamlit
I have developed this project with the aim of simplifying the loan application process and providing users with a quick and accurate decision on their loan eligibility. In this application, users can enter their details, such as income, credit score, and employment history. Leveraging the power of various machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and more, the system analyzes these details to determine whether the user is eligible for a loan or not.

This project not only streamlines the loan application process but also assists financial institutions in automating their decision-making procedures. It showcases the versatility and efficiency of machine learning in making informed predictions, and the user-friendly interface is powered by Streamlit, making it accessible and intuitive for users from all backgrounds. Whether it's a prospective borrower seeking a loan or a financial institution looking to optimize its lending processes, this application serves as a valuable tool in facilitating data-driven loan decisions.

To run a Streamlit application, follow these steps:

1. **Install Streamlit:**

   If you haven't already installed Streamlit, you can do so using pip (Python package manager):

   ```
   pip install streamlit
   ```

2. **Create Your Streamlit App:**

   Write your Streamlit app code in a Python script (e.g., `my_app.py`). You can use any text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.

   Here's a simple example of a Streamlit app:

   ```python
   # my_app.py
   import streamlit as st

   st.title('My First Streamlit App')
   st.write('Hello, Streamlit!')
   ```

3. **Run Your Streamlit App:**

   Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your `my_app.py` is located, and run the following command:

   ```
   streamlit run my_app.py
   ```

   Replace `my_app.py` with the name of your Streamlit app script.

4. **Access Your App:**

   After running the command, Streamlit will start a local development server and provide a URL (usually http://localhost:8501) where you can access your app in a web browser.

5. **Interact with Your App:**

   Your Streamlit app will now be running in your browser. You can interact with it as you would with any web application. Streamlit will automatically update the interface as you make changes to your code.

6. **Exit the App:**

   To stop the Streamlit app, simply close the terminal or command prompt where it's running.

Streamlit provides a simple and intuitive way to create data-driven web applications using Python. You can further enhance your app by adding widgets, charts, data visualizations, and more to make it interactive and informative. Refer to the Streamlit documentation (https://docs.streamlit.io) for detailed information on building and customizing Streamlit applications.
